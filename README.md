# Sulik text
This is my implemantation of text editor created using Qt and C++. I'm sorry, but in time of developing this project my PC with Windows broke so I fetched only Mac compilated version of program.

Here I added the function of changing style in the settings of application. Styles are described in the JSON file which are in resources.qrc file. I used for sidebar folder of project QFileSystemModel and TreeView(I used View-Model pattern).

This program can open few files in the same time in different tabs
